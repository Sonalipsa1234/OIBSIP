Basic Calculator Project in Java

The Basic Calculator is a console-based Java application designed to perform essential arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project provides a simple, user-friendly interface for performing calculations and serves as a foundational exercise in Java programming.

Features:
Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides one number by another with error handling to prevent division by zero.
Project Highlights:
Command-line interface that guides users to select operations and input numbers.
Modular design using separate methods for each arithmetic operation, improving readability and maintainability.
Input validation to ensure users enter valid numbers.
Exception handling to manage division by zero errors, making the program more user-friendly and robust.
Learning Outcomes:
This project strengthened core Java skills, such as:

Method creation and calling
Control structures (conditional statements and loops) for operation selection
Exception handling in Java for error-free execution
Technology Stack:
Language: Java
IDE: Visual Studio Code
